No issues found

No issues found

![](assets/images/image1.png)
There I had some issues:The reason why quizData is a underfined variable is because the question for Quiz are in seperate file(question.js)
Also during the check,it was found that some variables were written ,but not used,I resived the code and removed them,insome place i was missing semicolons.
